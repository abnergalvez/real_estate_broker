# Real Estate Broker  üè∑Ô∏è [1.0.0]

This is a prototype that showing the first steps for the construction of a system for a real estate brokerage company, which has clients (sellers), with their respective properties, and associated agents and interested buyers and also the management of their visits and shows their relationships.

This is part of a challenge requested by "Financia Capital".


## üì¶ Installation

There are two ways to run the application:

**A) Server integrated in Application:**

Dependencies: Mysql, Composer and PHP 7.3 or higher.

- Download the complete directory.

- With Composer installed run the following command (inside the application directory):
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
- Create a new database(mysql) with your favorite client.
- You must configure the .env file inside the application in the following variables:
    DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD
- Run the migrations and seeders
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
    ```
- Run the application with the following command:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

- Access http://localhost:8000/


**B) Run a Docker Container**

- Download the complete directory.

- With Docker installed run the following commands (inside the application directory):
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

- Access http://localhost:8000/

## üíª Usage

    Login in /login with the following credentials : 
    email: super@mail.cl
    password: 123123
    and you will be able to see in the home page, each item and its associated data. 

## ‚òù Assumptions, conventions and future improvements

- Within the requested requirements, it is assumed that there should be a brokerage agent, who is assigned a property and will assist in the management of the property (visits and sales).
Also an entity to buy/sell properties for future use.

- As required for the view I used blade and blade components.
- For the commit management I used "conventional commits" (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- For the rest of the requirements I used the own classes and methods included in Laravel.

- In future improvements we could include the CRUD needed for agents, sellers and buyers, as well as for the management of visits and purchases and their respective status changes.
- For now the construction of the relationships is shown by the seeders created and the methods in the models as such.
